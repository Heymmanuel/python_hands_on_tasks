Sum of angles of a triangle is 180°.

we have three angles in a triangle,
Let us apply basic math to derive formula for third angle. If two angles of a triangle are given, then third angle of triangle is given by :– 180 - (a + b)


Logic to find third angle of a triangle
Step by step descriptive logic to find third angle of a triangle –
(a)Input two angles of triangle from user. Store it in some variable say a and b.
(b)Compute third angle of triangle using formula c = 180 - (a + b).
(c)Print value of third angle i.e. print c.
